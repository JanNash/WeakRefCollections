# WeakRefCollections

![TravisCI build status: master](https://travis-ci.org/JanNash/WeakRefCollections.svg?branch=master) ![Cocoapods version: latest](https://cocoapod-badges.herokuapp.com/v/WeakRefCollections/badge.png)

### Summary

A lightweight ensemble of nifty Swift collections that support weak references to their elements and provide some other supposedly helpful tiny interface additions.

// TODO: Currently the framework only contains a weak reference array. 
The next additions are planned to be a dictionary, a set and a bidirectional dictionary.

### Installation

This framework can be installed via Cocoapods, just add  
```pod 'WeakRefCollections'```  
to the target you're planning to use it with.  

Don't forget to add  
```use_frameworks!```  
if it isn't there yet.

// TODO: Integrate framework with SPM.
